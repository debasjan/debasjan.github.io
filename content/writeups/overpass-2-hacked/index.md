Overpass has been hacked! Can you analyse the attacker's actions and hack back in?

## **Forensics - Analyse the PCAP**

Overpass has been hacked! The SOC team (Paradox, congratulations on the promotion) noticed suspicious activity on a late night shift while looking at shibes, and managed to capture packets as the attack happened.

Can you work out how the attacker got in, and hack your way back into Overpass' production server?

Note: Although this room is a walkthrough, it expects familiarity with tools and Linux. I recommend learning basic Wireshark and completing [Linux Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals) as a bare minimum.

## **Research - Analyse the code**

Now that you've found the code for the backdoor, it's time to analyse it.

###### Answer the questions below

What's the default hash for the backdoor?

What's the hardcoded salt for the backdoor?

What was the hash that the attacker used? - go back to the PCAP for this!

## **Attack - Get back in!**

Now that the incident is investigated, Paradox needs someone to take control of the Overpass production server again.

There's flags on the box that Overpass can't afford to lose by formatting the server!
